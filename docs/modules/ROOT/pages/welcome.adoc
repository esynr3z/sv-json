= Welcome

Welcome to the homepage of {url-svjson-github}[`svjson`] project!

The project introduces JSON decoder and encoder in pure SystemVerilog without any external dependencies.

* JSON decoder can parse values from string or file
* JSON encoder can dump values to string or file
* JSON values (object, array, string, number, bool) are represented with collection of wrapper classes
* JSON encoding capability can be added to user classes with collection of interface classes
* Additional classes for encoding SystemVerilog enums and bit vectors of any width
* Error reporting and propagation system inspired by Rust

Implementation follows {url-ecma-404}[ECMA standard] with some limitations:

* `\b` and `\u` escape sequences are not supported for decoder/encoder
* Nesting depth is limited for decoder (1024 by default, limit is controllable)
* No recursion detection for encoder

IMPORTANT: The package is developed and tested using {url-verilator-github}[Verilator 5.24] only. Support of other simulators is planned, but Verilator still will be the main simulator for project as it is the only viable option to organize CI and opensource flow.

| {url-ieee-compatible-uvm-2018}[Slides]
| Slides contain references to a JSON `uvm_printer` with some code.

| SNUG 2013, Applications of Custom UVM Report Servers, Gordon Mc Gregor
| {url-custom-uvm-report-servers}[Artice], {url-verilab-uvm-structured-logs}[sources]
| Article mentions JSON implementation of UVM server, however, link to the code doesn't work.

| UVM Tutorial for Candy Lovers â€“ 33. Defining do_print
| {url-uvm-tutorial-for-candy-lovers-defining-do_print}[Link]
| Famous UVM tutorial shows how to implement simple JSON `uvm_printer` with code.

| JSON.sv
| {url-milestone12-json}[Github]
| Implementation of JSON encoder/decoder in SystemVerilog. Integrated into {url-fusesoc}[FuseSoc] ecosystem.
It has only few tests and almost no documentation.

| JSONPacketParser
| {url-quinnwerks-jsonpacketparser}[Github]
| Project uses {url-jsmn}[the JSMN library] to parse a JSON file into a C data structure. This data structure is then passed to a SystemVerilog testbench via DPI.

| JSONinSV
| {url-zhouchuanrui-jsoninsv}[Github]
| JSON encoder and decoder in SystemVerilog. It is well tested (own framework is introduced). Project comes with a nicely structured README (on Chinese, though).

| JSON-for-VHDL
| {url-json-for-vhdl}[Github]
| JSON decoder in VHDL. Tested against well-known {url-json-test-suite}[JSON Test Suite].
